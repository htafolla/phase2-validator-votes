Here are the criteria for the Open Shards pool vote:

- [x] **Inflation enabled Results** - On TestNet or another network running the current MainNet build
- [x] **2FA fixed** - Many community members are unable to delegate, providing them the opportunity is critical and fair
- [ ] **1 Week after 2FA fixed** - This will allow time for delegators to take action, unless 185M delegated is reached first.
- [x] **35 MainNet validators** - Enough nodes with the stake spread to ensure that the network is stable
- [x] **67 Seats spread across 7+ validators** - This ensures network stability. We should invoke a campaign to help with this
- [ ] **A clear and published Code Red process** - Telegram, Email, Discord where will critical information be communicated?
- [ ] **185M Delegated** - 50% of the lockup contract distributions **(Optional)**
- [ ] **An additional MainNet Release** - We need further testing on MainNet releases and failback scenarios. **(Optional)**
- [ ] **NEAR delegation documenation** - How to delegate with Web Wallet, 2FA, Command Line and Ledger using NEAR tooling **(Optional)**
